# Not Wii Tanks or Atari Combat
Update this! 
Tanks is played according to the following rules:
- Players can move up, down, left, and right using A and D
- Players can aim shots using W and S
- Two players will have to navigate the screen and try to destroy the other tank while avoiding the flying bullets
- If a player gets hit by a bullet(including their own!):
    - they lose the level and you can choose to move on
